    \begin{question}
        Given a set of $C$ courses, suppose for a course $c \in C$, $L(c)$ denotes the list of all the courses that must be completed before crediting c. Design an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm to compute a pair set $P \subseteq C \times C$ such that for any $(c, c_0 ) \in P$ , the intersection $L(c) \cap L(c_0 )$ is empty.
