    \begin{question}
        Given a set of $C$ courses, devise the most efficient algorithm to find minimum number of semesters needed to complete all $n$ courses. What is the time complexity of your algorithm? 
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        Proof is left as an exercise.
        
        
        \begin{algorithm}
        \caption{Least number of semesters for completion}
        \begin{algorithmic}
        \Procedure{Semester}{$G$}
        \State{$adjList \gets generateAdjList(G)$} \Comment{Creates an adjacency list in O(V+E) time}
        \State{}
        \State{$indegree \gets [0 for all v in V]$}
        \State{$colour[node] \gets 0$ for all nodes} 
        \EndProcedure
        \end{algorithmic}
        \end{algorithm}
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of correctness]
        %@TODO: correctness is boring
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of termination]
        
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Time Complexity]
        The overall time complexity of the $Semester$ function becomes $O(V+E)$
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Space Complexity]
        Space complexity is determined by size of $adjList$ adjacency list, $indegree$ array, $sem$ array and $q$ queue.In worst case, space complexity $=O(V+E)+O(V)+O(V)+O(V)=O(V+E)$
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
