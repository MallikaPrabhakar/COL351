    \begin{question}
        You are given a set of $k$ denominations. Devise a polynomial time algorithm to count the number of ways to make change for Rs.$n$, given an infinite amount of coins/notes of denominations, $d[1], . . . , d[k]$.
    \end{question}
    \tcblower{}
    \begin{proof}[Assumptions]
    Following assumptions are made:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Number of coins of every denomination are infinite
            \item Denominations are integral values
            \item Atleast one solution (way of representing $n$) exists
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        We solved this problem using dynamic programming. Given the cost $n$ and array of possible denominations $denom$ with size $m$, we create $dpTable$ which is an $(n+1)\times(m)$ matrix. $Row \ 0$ is used to denote our target state $n=0$ and remaining rows represent intermediate $n$ values and the number of ways particular $i$ value can be obtained after including or excluding current $j$ value i.e. mentioned denomination of the $cell=dpTable[i][j]$.
        The answer is obtained by observing value of the last cell $dpTable[n][m-1]$.
