    \begin{question}
        You are given a set of $k$ denominations. Device a polynomial time algorithm to find a change of Rs.$n$ using the minimum number of
coins.    
    \end{question}
    \tcblower{}
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        The assumptions made are that the number of coins of every denomination are infinite and they are integral values.\\
        \begin{algorithm}[H]
        \caption{Find total possible combinations of denominations to achieve value of n}
        \begin{algorithmic}
        \Procedure{LeastCurr}{$denom,n$}
            \State{$k \gets size(denom)$}   \Comment{number of types of denominations}
            \State{$dpArr \gets$ array of size $n+1$ initialised with $\infty$}
            \State{$dpArr[0] \gets 0$} \Comment{Base case: no coin needed $n=0$}
            \For{$index$ in $[1, n+1]$}
                \For{$i$ in $[0, k)$}
                    \If{$index-denom[i]\geq 0$}
                        \State{$dpArr[index] \gets min(dpArr[index],dpArr[index-denom[i]]+1)$}
                    \EndIf{}
                \EndFor{}
            \EndFor{}
            \State{\Return{$dpArr[n]$}}
        \EndProcedure{}
        \end{algorithmic}
        \end{algorithm}
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of correctness]
        %@TODO: correctness is boring
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of termination]
        We iterate through the entire array of size n and exit successfully in any case. Hence the algorithm terminates.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Time Complexity]
    Deciding factors for time-complexity in big-Oh notation are going through the entire $dpArray$ and running a for loop of $k$ iterations for each index.\\
    Time complexity $=O(n\times k)$\\
    This is a polynomial time solution.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Space Complexity]
    We create a $dpArray$ of size $n+1$ and use constant space everywhere else.\\
    Space complexity $=O(n)$
    \end{proof}
% stuff I changed:
% reversed the order of the loops, that is important to get the correct results (also refer https://usaco.guide/problems/cses-1634-minimizing-coins/solution)
% corrected the time complexity
% added space complexity
\end{solution}
