    Prove that Hitting Set is NP-complete by reducing Vertex-cover to Hitting Set.
    \end{question}
    \tcblower{}
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
    
    \begin{claim}
    A problem $X$ in NP class is NP-complete if for every $A \in NP$ we have $A \leq_P X$
    \end{claim}
    We will be reducing Vertex-cover problem to Hitting-set problem. On proving  to prove Hitting-set is NP Hard problem.
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
