Fixed length encoding means that each symbol (or codeword) is coded with the same number of bits.
\\
HUffman encoding: greedy strategy by making a tree and every left edge is 0 and right edge is 1 and child distribution on the basis of frequency of char
\\
to prove: they'll be both same if freq of max is less than twice of freq of min
\\
Well on merging, the small ones will reach the top, then lower two will be meged again and go higher
\\ hence stuff improves but no. of bits will appear to be const. so yea
\\both same
