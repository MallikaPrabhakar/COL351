\begin{solution}{Question 1.b}
    \begin{question}[]
        What is the optimal binary Huffman encoding for $n$ letters whose frequencies are the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers? What will be the encoding of the two letters with frequency $1$, in the optimal binary Huffman encoding?
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        We begin by observing the property of Fibonacci numbers:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                f(n)&=f(n-1)+f(n-2)\ \forall n\geq 3\\
                \text{and, } f(1)&=f(2)=1
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        Now, consider an alphabet $A=(a_1, a_2, \ldots,a_n)$ such that it has a frequency vector $V=(1, 1, \ldots, f(n))$. We have the following claim for such a situation:
        \begin{claim}
            The Huffman tree is unique and $a_n$ gets encoded using a single bit.
        \end{claim}
        \begin{proof}
            We will prove the claim using induction on $n$.
        \end{proof}
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
